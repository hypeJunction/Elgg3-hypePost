hypePost
========

Provides utilities for creating and editing posts.

**Extendable form fields**
Post forms are built using an extended field API layer, which makes it easier to define
all fields in one place, and not have to worry about maintaining form, action and profile
logic separate from each other.

**Reusable views**
Plugins can recycle existing resource views, saving lots of time needed to bootstrap new entity types.

**Client site validation**
Client side form validation

**AJAX form save**
Forms are saved using AJAX with saves user a few steps should the action fail.


## Form Fields

To extend post form, use ``fields, <entity_type>:<entity_subtype>`` (or less granular ``fields, <entity_type>`` ) plugin hook.
 
The hook receives an instance of ``\hypeJunction\Fields\Collection``, which allows you to easily manipulate fields:

```php
elgg_register_plugin_hook_handler('fields', 'object:blog', function(\Elgg\Hook $hook) {

	$fields = $hook->getValue();
	/* @var $fields \hypeJunction\Fields\Collection */
	
	$fields->add('published_date', new MetaField([
		'type' => 'date',
		'required' => true,
	]);
	
	$fields->get('description')->required = false;
	
	return $fields;
});
```
